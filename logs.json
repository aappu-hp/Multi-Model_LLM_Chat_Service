This counting system was later adopted by other civilizations like Greek and Roman empires, which integrated it into their own numerical systems.\n\nThe number zero is thus a relatively recent invention that has evolved over time across different cultural and historical contexts, including ancient China, India, and ancient Persia/Afghanistan.",
